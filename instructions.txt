To run the program, simply run

"python3 neural_net.py"

To change values of the hyperparamters, they are set at the very bottom of the file, lines 472-494. 
To run the backprop_examples, uncomment the lines 474-476 for example 1 and 480-482 for example 2.
To test with different data sets, at the very top of the file simply comment out one file name and uncomment the other. 
Along with that, at the bottom of the file uncomment the relevant net_shape for the data set being tested.
To test the regularized cost of the program, set k_folds=1 at line 486 and uncomment the lines 44-46, 49-52, and 224.
Currently, the data set is running the house votes data set with 10 folds and a regularization parameter of 0.
